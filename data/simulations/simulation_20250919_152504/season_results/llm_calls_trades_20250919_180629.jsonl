Swapping Deebo Samuel Sr. (24-406-1 receiving, 66 rush yards, 1 rush TD) and low-usage Zamir White (164 rush yards, 6-30 receiving, 0 TDs) for David Montgomery (415 rush yards, 7 rush TDs, 14-138 receiving, plus a passing TD) and Christian Watson (13-196-2) gives us a clear RB2 with strong TD production while maintaining ample WR depth. For you, this upgrades WR from Watson to Deebo and still leaves you with robust RB depth (Kenneth Walker III, Brian Robinson Jr.) after moving Montgomery, while adding White as bench RB depth.\"\n}"}
