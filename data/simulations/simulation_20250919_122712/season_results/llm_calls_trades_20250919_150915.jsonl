Christian McCaffrey (RB)\n2. Dak Prescott (QB)\n\nYou are receiving:\n1. Kyren Williams (RB)\n2. Jahmyr Gibbs (RB)\n\nFirst, let's assess the positions and the impact of this trade on your roster, Qwen_3_Max_Team_1.\n\n- You are losing a top RB (Christian McCaffrey) and a QB (Dak Prescott).\n- You are gaining two RBs (Kyren Williams and Jahmyr Gibbs).\n\nYour original roster format is: 1 QB, 2 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE, 1 FLEX, 5 BENCH.\n\nAfter the trade:\n- You will have 0 Dak Prescott (QB), so you'll rely on other QBs you have. Let's assume you have others like Patrick Mahomes as mentioned.\n- You will lose Christian McCaffrey, a strong RB, and gain two RBs, Kyren Williams and Jahmyr Gibbs, making your RB depth stronger but potentially losing a starter.\n\nThe counter proposal rationale mentions that you have ample WR options, which is crucial since your WR spots are not directly affected by this trade. However, the trade significantly impacts your QB and RB positions.\n\nTo determine if this is beneficial, let's consider the players' stats and the scoring format. However, since specific stats for these players are not provided, we'll have to make a general assessment.\n\nThe trade gives you two RBs for one RB and one QB. If you have a strong QB depth as implied, losing Dak Prescott might not be as significant, but it's still a starter-level QB. You are also losing a very talented RB in Christian McCaffrey.\n\nGiven the information and the fact that you're not directly provided with the current stats or the rest of your roster, a detailed statistical analysis isn't possible. However, we can still reason based on the positions and the general value of the players mentioned.\n\nSince you're getting two RBs for one RB and one QB, your RB depth increases, which could be beneficial given your roster format requires 2 RBs and 1 FLEX, which can often be an RB. However, you're losing a high-value QB and a top RB.\n\nLet's construct a response. Since the trade isn't clearly in your favor due to the loss of a starter QB and a top RB, and you're gaining RB depth, a reasonable next step could be to counter.\n\nHere's a potential counter that maintains the 2-for-2 trade size:\nYou could propose giving up Christian McCaffrey and Drake London (assuming you have Drake London and he's a WR starter or significant contributor) and receiving Kyren Williams and a WR like George Pickens (though George Pickens isn't mentioned, this is just an example; we'll stick with the players given).\n\nHowever, we need to work with the players and information given. A straightforward counter isn't directly feasible without knowing the rest of your roster or the exact stats. \n\nLet's directly evaluate the given counter proposal. Since we can't directly assess the benefit without stats, let's think about the general value.\n\nA potential counter could involve maintaining QB depth while adjusting RBs or other positions. However, we are constrained by the players given.\n\nLet's form a JSON response. Since the counter proposal isn't clearly beneficial and involves losing a top RB and a QB for two RBs, a logical step is to counter.\n\nHere's a JSON response that represents a counter:\n```json\n{\"decision\": \"counter\", \"give\": [{\"name\":\"Dak Prescott\",\"position\":\"QB\"}, {\"name\":\"Christian McCaffrey\",\"position\":\"RB\"}], \"receive\": [{\"name\":\"Kyren Williams\",\"position\":\"RB\"}, {\"name\":\"Tua Tagovailoa\",\"position\":\"QB\"}], \"rationale\": \"Countering with Tua Tagovailoa for Dak Pres"}
