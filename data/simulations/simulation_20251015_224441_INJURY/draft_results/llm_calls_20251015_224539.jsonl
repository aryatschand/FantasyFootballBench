While De'Von Achane showed explosive potential in 2023, his 2024 projection is significantly lower, and he only has one year of data. Rachaad White and Alvin Kamara are RBs with good receiving upside, but Pittman Jr.'s 2023 receiving numbers are superior to both. Cooper Kupp's 2023 numbers are good, but Pittman Jr. edged him out in receptions and yards, and given the existing WR (Puka Nacua) who is also a strong receiver, adding another high-volume receiver like Pittman Jr. provides a solid and consistent option, especially with the potential for a high target share. The immediate need for a second WR with proven high volume makes Pittman Jr. the best pick among the options."}}

Since I have 5 bench spots to fill and my current roster has 4 WRs, 3 RBs, 1 QB, and 1 TE, I am overstocked at WR and RB for starting positions. My QB and TE positions are filled. The prompt states 'If you have an empty roster position, you MUST draft a player for that position.' My bench is currently 0/5, meaning I have 5 empty bench spots. Therefore, I need to draft 5 players to fill these bench spots. I will prioritize drafting the top available WRs to fill these bench spots, as WRs often offer high upside and can be rotated into the FLEX position if needed. I am selecting the top 5 available WRs to research as they represent the best available talent to fill my empty bench spots and potentially provide future starting value or trade bait."}}

Dobbins is the only one with verified past performance data (520 rushing yards and 3 total TDs in 2022), indicating he has produced at the NFL level before. All other candidates have no data for 2022 or 2023 and zero projected stats for 2024, making them extremely speculative. Despite a limited 2023 and low 2024 projection, Dobbins has demonstrated prior capability, giving him a clear edge based solely on the provided information."}}
