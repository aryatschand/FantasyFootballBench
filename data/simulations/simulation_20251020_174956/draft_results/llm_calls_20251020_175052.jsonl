For now, I need to fill my bench. Since the prompt asks for 5 players to research next, and I have a significant surplus of RBs, I will focus on researching the top 5 available RBs to potentially strengthen my bench or use as trade bait later, assuming I will need to make roster adjustments to fit the 2 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE structure.
