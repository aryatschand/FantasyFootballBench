Functionally, our team does not need to trade for a TE upgrade since we already have Sam LaPorta, and a 1-TE lineup limits the value of holding two elite TEs. This counter improves our starting WR/FLEX by adding Ja'Marr Chase\u2014valuable in full PPR with yardage scoring\u2014while replacing LaPorta with Kelce laterally at TE. We can afford to move David Montgomery because we retain RB depth with Saquon Barkley, Raheem Mostert, Jaylen Warren, and Tyjae Spears. For the proposer, this addresses a clear RB need (their roster lists only Zamir White at RB) and still leaves them very strong at TE with LaPorta while they trade from WR/TE surplus.\"\n}"}
