While Ferguson had more TDs, McBride's higher yardage and receptions suggest a more consistent and impactful role. Between the running backs, Josh Jacobs had a strong 2022 but a significant drop-off in 2023, and De'Von Achane had a good 2023 but is projected for very low numbers in 2024. Jordan Love is a QB, and a second QB is not a priority at this stage. Therefore, Trey McBride offers the best combination of recent performance and filling a roster need."}}

Top WRs Deebo Samuel Sr. and Malik Nabers address the WR need. Top TE Kyle Pitts fills the TE spot. Javonte Williams is included as a potential trade candidate or depth, but primarily because FLEX could still use elite RB upside and current RBs may have injury risks; however, strictly following instructions, we must consider only provided data. Given the overstock at RB, prioritizing elite WRs and TE makes sense, but the fifth slot goes to Javonte Williams as the top available RB in case of injury or trade, and because FLEX could still benefit from high-upside RBs. However, re-evaluating: since RB is already at 5/2 (meaning 5 RBs for 2 starting spots + FLEX), and FLEX can be WR/TE too, it's safer to prioritize WR/TE. But the prompt says 'research next', not final pick. So including top options across needed positions: QB, WR, TE, and maybe another WR. But we must pick exactly 5 from the lists. The top QB is essential. Two top WRs are needed. One top TE is needed. That\u2019s 4. The fifth should be another WR or TE for FLEX/BENCH depth. However, the suggested lists only give 5 WRs and 5 TEs. Since Amari Cooper and Tee Higgins are also top WRs, but Deebo and Nabers are top 2. For TE, Pitts is top. So fifth could be another WR like Tee Higgins. But the instruction says choose exactly 5 from the suggested lists. Given the roster needs, the most critical are QB, 2 WR, TE, and then another WR or TE for FLEX. However, the assistant must choose 5 to research. The top QB, top 2 WR, top TE, and next WR makes sense. But the answer above includes Javonte Williams. Wait, the roster has 5 RBs already, so RB is not needed. Therefore, the fifth should be another WR or TE. So candidates should be: Caleb Williams (QB), Deebo Samuel Sr. (WR), Malik Nabers (WR), Kyle Pitts (TE), and Tee Higgins (WR). But the initial answer included Javonte Williams. That was a mistake. Correcting: since RB is overfilled, no need to research RBs. So the 5 should be QB, 3 WR, 1 TE. But the roster needs 2 WR, but FLEX can be WR, so 3 WRs are useful. So the correct 5: Caleb Williams, Deebo Samuel Sr., Malik Nabers, Tee Higgins, Kyle Pitts. However, the user's suggested top WR includes Tee Higgins as #3. So replacing Javonte Williams with Tee Higgins. But the initial response had Javonte. Need to fix. Final decision: QB (Caleb), WRs (Deebo, Nabers, Higgins), TE (Pitts). So the correct candidates are those five."}}

Since the prompt states 'If you have an empty roster position, you MUST draft a player for that position,' and the goal is to research players for the *next* pick, the most pressing need is to fill the bench. However, the prompt also states 'By the end of the draft, you MUST draft a player for each position on your roster.' Given the current roster has 3 WRs for 2 WR slots and 1 FLEX slot, it implies one of the WRs will likely fill the FLEX. The most immediate need is to fill the bench spots. Since the prompt asks for players to research *next* and not necessarily to draft immediately, and given the current roster has 3 WRs for 2 WR slots and 1 FLEX, it's reasonable to assume one of the existing WRs will fill the FLEX. This leaves the bench as the primary area to fill. However, the prompt asks for 5 players to research, and the available lists are categorized by position. Since the roster is already over on WRs, and the bench is empty, the best strategy for research is to look at the top available players in positions that are still valuable for depth or potential future trades, even if not immediately needed for a starting slot. Given the current roster has 3 WRs (A.J. Brown, Nico Collins, Drake London) for 2 WR slots and 1 FLEX, it's likely one of these will occupy the FLEX. This means the starting WR and FLEX positions are effectively filled. The remaining need is for bench players. Since there are no specific 'bench' players listed, and the prompt asks for 5 names to research, and the current roster is already over on WRs, it makes sense to look at the top available WRs for potential depth on the bench, as WRs often have high upside and can be traded or fill in due to injury. Therefore, researching the top 5 available WRs is a logical step for potential bench depth, even though the starting WR and FLEX spots are seemingly covered by the existing roster."}}

From the available RBs, Gus Edwards, J.K. Dobbins, and Zach Charbonnet are top options. One WR (Rome Odunze) is added for depth and FLEX potential. The TE position is already filled, but Tyler Conklin is the top available TE and could be a backup or trade asset, and TE depth is often valuable.
