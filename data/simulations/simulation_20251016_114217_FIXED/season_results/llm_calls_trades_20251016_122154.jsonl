The current QB, Jalen Hurts, has stats that are somewhat inconsistent, with 3 interceptions in 2 games, which might be a concern.\n\nLet's evaluate Jalen Hurts' performance:\n- Passing Yards: 461\n- Passing TDs: 3\n- Interceptions: 3\n- Rushing Yards: 118\n- Rushing TDs: 1\n\nThe scoring format rewards passing yards (0.04 pts/yard), passing TDs (4 pts), and penalizes interceptions (-2 pts). Thus, Hurts' passing performance yields: (461 * 0.04) + (3 * 4) + (-2 * 3) = 18.44 + 12 - 6 = 24.44 points. His rushing performance adds: (118 * 0.1) + (1 * 6) = 11.8 + 6 = 17.8 points. Total = 24.44 + 17.8 = 42.24 points in 2 games.\n\nTo strengthen the QB position, we need to look for a QB on another team who has performed well. Let's examine the QBs on other teams:\n\n1. Team Claude_Opus_4.1_Team_8: Jared Goff (PY=524, PTD=1, INT=3), Joe Burrow (PY=422, PTD=2, INT=0), Anthony Richardson (PY=416, PTD=3, INT=4)\n2. Team GPT_5_Mini_Team_10: C.J. Stroud (PY=494, PTD=3, INT=0), Tua Tagovailoa (PY=483, PTD=2, INT=3)\n3. Team GPT_OSS_Team_3: Jordan Love (PY=260, PTD=2, INT=1), Kyler Murray (PY=428, PTD=4, INT=0), Justin Herbert (PY=274, PTD=3, INT=1), Dak Prescott (PY=472, PTD=2, INT=2)\n4. Team Gemini_2.5_Flash_Team_6: Josh Allen (PY=371, PTD=3, INT=0), Lamar Jackson (PY=520, PTD=2, INT=1)\n5. Team Gemini_2.5_Pro_Team_5: Trevor Lawrence (PY=382, PTD=1, INT=0)\n6. Team Kimi_K2_Team_4: Patrick Mahomes (PY=442, PTD=3, INT=3)\n\nAmong these, C.J. Stroud stands out for his 3 TD passes and 0 interceptions in 2 games, making him an attractive option.\n\nNow, let's form a trade proposal. Since Qwen_3_Max_Team_1 is looking to strengthen its QB position and has depth in other positions, a 1-for-1 trade could be considered if a suitable QB is found.\n\nHere's a potential trade:\n- Give: Brandon Aiyuk (WR)\n- Receive: C.J. Stroud (QB) from Team GPT_5_Mini_Team_10\n\nRationale: Brandon Aiyuk has performed decently with 6 receptions for 71 yards in 2 games, but C.J. Stroud's potential as a QB with high passing TDs and no interceptions makes him a more valuable asset for strengthening the QB position. This trade helps Team GPT_5_Mini_Team_10 by potentially improving their WR corps, as they might be looking for consistent WR performance."}

Gaining Jayden Reed (WR) is slightly less productive than CeeDee Lamb but still a productive WR.\n\nThe counter proposal seems to be relatively balanced and slightly in favor of Qwen_3_Max_Team_1 due to the upgrade at TE and maintaining a strong WR corps.\n\nSince the counter proposal is reasonable and slightly beneficial, the decision is to accept it.\n\n{\"decision\": \"accept\"}"}
