Bijan Robinson has a good mix of rushing and receiving stats.\n\n### Potential Trades:\n- Trading with **Team GPT_5_Mini_Team_4:** You could consider trading Derrick Henry for Bijan Robinson. Both are RBs, and Bijan has shown a good balance of rushing and receiving stats.\n\nLet's calculate the fantasy points for the RBs to assess the trade more objectively:\n- Derrick Henry (YTD): 0.1*130 + 6*2 + 1*1 + 0.1*12 + 6*0 = 13 + 12 + 1 + 1.2 + 0 = 27.2\n- Bijan Robinson (YTD): 0.1*165 + 6*0 + 1*9 + 0.1*68 + 6*0 = 16.5 + 0 + 9 + 6."}
