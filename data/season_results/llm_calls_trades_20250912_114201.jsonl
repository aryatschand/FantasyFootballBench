The counteroffer is to give Dak Prescott and receive Josh Allen.\n\n## Step 2: Assess the value of the players involved in both offers.\nJalen Hurts is a strong QB with both passing and rushing abilities, while Justin Herbert is also a talented QB known for his passing accuracy and arm strength. Dak Prescott is another skilled QB with a good balance of passing and rushing, and Josh Allen is a dynamic QB with strong rushing and passing skills.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the team's needs and the potential impact of each player.\nGiven the roster format and scoring system, having a well-rounded QB who can contribute in both passing and rushing is valuable. Both Jalen Hurts and Dak Prescott offer this, but the question is whether the upgrade to Justin Herbert or Josh Allen is significant enough.\n\n## Step 4: Compare the counteroffer to the initial proposal.\nThe initial proposal involved giving up Jalen Hurts for Justin Herbert, which could be seen as a lateral move given both players' skills. The counteroffer involves giving up Dak Prescott for Josh Allen, which also seems like a lateral move but with different players.\n\n## Step 5: Decide based on the team's current needs and the players' values.\nConsidering the team's needs and the players' values, it seems that the counteroffer does not significantly improve the team's position over the initial proposal. However, since the counteroffer is of equal value and does not clearly benefit or harm the team more than the initial proposal, it's essential to consider the long-term strategy and current team composition.\n\n## Step 6: Final decision.\nGiven that the counteroffer does not clearly benefit the team more than the initial proposal and considering the need for a strong QB, the decision should be based on which QB pair (Jalen Hurts for Justin Herbert or Dak Prescott for Josh Allen) is more beneficial in the long run. Since both are lateral moves, the focus should be on which QB has the higher upside or better fits the team's strategy.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed"}

Since the receiver already has Travis Kelce as a strong TE starter, adding Sam LaPorta would mostly contribute to depth rather than improving the starting lineup. However, Courtland Sutton could potentially improve the starting WR position.\n\n## Step 2: Assess the proposal's impact on the team's depth.\nThe receiver has a surplus of tight ends but is thin at running back. Trading away Najee Harris would further deplete the RB position, which is a concern. However, the addition of Courtland Sutton would add depth to the WR position.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the expected points impact of the trade.\nGiven the scoring format, WRs tend to score more points than TEs due to reception and yardage points. Courtland Sutton could potentially increase the team's expected points. However, the loss of Najee Harris might offset this gain due to the importance of having a reliable RB2.\n\n## Step 4: Determine if the proposal benefits the team overall.\nWhile the trade improves WR depth and potentially the starting lineup, it significantly weakens the RB position. This trade-off does not clearly benefit the team overall, especially considering the importance of RBs in this scoring format.\n\n## Step 5: Decide on the response to the proposal.\nSince the proposal does not clearly benefit the team, a counteroffer is necessary. The counter should aim to address the team's RB depth issue while potentially leveraging the surplus of TEs.\n\n## Step 6: Formulate a counteroffer.\nGiven the need to improve RB depth and the surplus of TEs, a logical counter would involve trading a TE for an RB. Since the original proposal involved two players on each side, the counter should also be 2-for-2 to maintain the trade's size and fairness.\n\n## Step 7: Specify the counteroffer.\nTrade Cole Kmet and Mike Gesicki for Najee Harris and Rico Dowdle. This counter aims to address the RB depth issue by acquiring Najee Harris and Rico Dowdle, who can provide immediate support to Jonathan Taylor, while trading away two TEs from the team's surplus.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{{\"decision\": \"counter\", \"give\": [{\"name\":\"Cole Kmet\",\"position\":\"TE\"}, {\"name\":\"Mike Gesicki\",\"position\":\"TE\"}], \"receive"}
